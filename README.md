# BDsplit
This is a pretty simple script I wrote in Python to speed up the process of making legal backups of my BD and DVD collection, the script will break a large chaptered index file into individual files by chapter and then compress them using handbrake. You need handbrake to run this (obviously), other than that it should be good to go. &lt;3
